== Overview ==

AprQ2 installation is fairly straightforward. Type 'make' to build the game.
Feel free to edit Makefile to meet your needs, but do so at your own peril.
By default, the binaries will be built to the 'releasei386' directory.  Copy
them to an appropriate path (e.g. ~/.quake2, /usr/share/games/quake2, etc).

== Dependencies ==

This version of AprQ2 should compile cleanly on recent Linux distributions and
on Apple OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). For Linux, you should install libSDL and
libCURL via your package manager. For OS X, you should install libSDL and 
libCURL through MacPorts.

If you get stuck installing dependencies, try the instructions for your
platform here:

== Installation ==

1. Create your Quake2 directory.
  mkdir -p ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
2. Install the Quake2 game data
  cp /path/to/pak*.pak ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
3. Compile AprQ2
  cd /path/to/aprq2/trunk
  make -j3

4. Install the binaries
  install bin/aq2 ~/.quake2
  install bin/game.so ~/.quake2/baseq2
  
5. Install the optional game data (recommended)
  svn export --force data ~/.quake2

6. Start the game
  cd ~/.quake2
  ./aq2
  
== High-resolution textures ==

R1CH (http://r1ch.net) has provided an excellent high-color, high-resolution
texture "pak" that looks fantastic in AprQ2. It has been included in this
distribution. If you don't like the textures, use gl_replacewal 0.
